### Generate a Self-Signed TLS Certificate for Vault

The following command generates a self-signed TLS certificate for HashiCorp Vault, using OpenSSL. This certificate is valid for 365 days and uses RSA-2048 encryption. The command also specifies a Common Name (CN) for the certificate and includes Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for additional domain names associated with the Vault service.

```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout vault_tls.key -out vault_tls.crt -subj "/CN=vault.hashibank.com" -extensions SAN -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:vault.hashibank.com,DNS:vault-dc1.hashibank.com,DNS:vault-dc2.hashibank.com"))
```

This command is particularly useful for setting up TLS encryption for Vault instances to ensure secure communication.
